# scss-hover-media-query-wrapper
Automatically wraps :hover blocks in SCSS files with a media query targeting hover-capable devices. Ensures hover effects are applied only on devices with precise pointers (e.g., desktop), improving UX on touchscreens. Scans all .scss files in a directory and updates them automatically.
